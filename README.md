An ever updating collection of code golf snippets

## What is code golf?
Wikipedia explains it rather well: code golf is a type of recreational computer
programming competition in which participants strive to achieve the shortest
possible source code that implements a certain algorithm.

It's important to realize that the constraint is on the size of the code itself
and has nothing to do with the size of the resulting binary.
